    <p>
      we all love us some <strong>lovely brownies</strong> at the end of the
      day, so lets enjoy <br />
      a 5 minute recipie from simple ingridents we can easily find. They Are:
      <br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sugar: These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar.</li>
      <li>Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the batter.</li>
      <li>
        Butter: Two sticks of melted butter give the brownies moisture and
        richness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eggs: Eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cocoa powder: Of course, you'll need cocoa powder for chocolate
        brownies!
      </li>
      <li>
        Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps
        the <br />
        brownies rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Walnuts: Nuts are optional, of course, but they add a welcome crunch.
      </li>
    </ul>
